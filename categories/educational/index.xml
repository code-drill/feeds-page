      <description>📢 In the latest &amp;ldquo;Improving Code Quality&amp;rdquo; article, Munetoshi Ishikawa discusses handling shape data as strings. The string format includes a &amp;ldquo;tag&amp;rdquo; for the shape type and attributes like coordinates. For example, a circle is represented as &amp;ldquo;circle 10 20 30&amp;rdquo;. Ishikawa presents a code implementation that defines different shape classes and a common factory function for creating these shapes efficiently.
