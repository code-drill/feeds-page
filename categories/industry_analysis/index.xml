      <description>Companies are rapidly adopting agentic AI, but nearly 50% of deployments fail due to poor ROI. Instead of creating a single &amp;lsquo;super agent,&amp;rsquo; businesses should develop specialized agents for specific tasks, like data entry or information retrieval. This approach improves efficiency and allows for better management and transparency. Using multiple agents can enhance collaboration and productivity, as seen with AIG&amp;rsquo;s use of 80 agents for underwriting. #AI #Automation #BusinessStrategy #TechTrends</description>
