      <description>Perplexity, an AI-powered answer engine, is reportedly using stealth tactics to bypass website no-crawl directives. They modify user agents and change IPs to continue crawling despite explicit blocks. This behavior contradicts the trust-based principles of the internet, which emphasize transparency and adherence to website preferences. As a result, Perplexity has been de-listed as a verified bot and is facing new blocking measures. #Crawling #AI #WebSecurity #DataPrivacy #TechNews 🕵️‍♂️🔍🚫</description>
