<p>Exploring the capabilities of LLMs in Filipino languages is
essential. 🇵🇭 FilBench, a new evaluation suite, assesses LLM fluency,
translation, and cultural knowledge in Tagalog and Cebuano. Despite high
ChatGPT usage in the Philippines, systematic evaluations are lacking.
The study evaluates over 20 LLMs, aiming to provide clear insights. 📄

<p>🚀 Netflix has developed an automated method for video quality
control that detects pixel-level artifacts, reducing manual reviews.
This new system identifies hot pixels that can distract viewers,
ensuring a seamless viewing experience. By using a specialized neural
network, Netflix speeds up the QC process from hours to minutes. This
innovation allows creative teams to focus more on storytelling rather
than technical issues. 🎥✨ #Netflix #VideoQuality #Innovation

.. type: text
-->
<p>At Wise we’re building the best way to move and manage the world’s
money — making it faster, cheaper, convenient and transparent. Product
uptime and availability is contributing to three parts of our mission:An
honest and meaningful uptime report is key to drive transparency of our
systems.High availability is one of the greatest factors in making our
product convenient. It is very hard to be convenient if the product is
not working as designed.High availability means less retries and less
waiting, driving us closer to instant too.In this post we will talk
about the reporting aspect of uptime and availability, focusing on
transparency. We would like to share our journey and various technical
considerations towards measuring meaningful availability/uptime for
Wise.Wise has a wide range of product offerings, condensing the
availability or uptime of our business flows is not trivial. These flows
consist of multiple business operations with various branches depending
on user intent or group.Providing a single number as business flow
availability or uptime is always going to be an approximation, but we
can and should be transparent about how we aggregate and what that
represents.Our goal is to have a meaningful measurement we can get
behind as representative of user-experienced
uptime/availability.DefinitionsFirst things first, let’s define some
terms we’ll use:Business flow: A high level, complex use-case of the
Wise product, e.g. “send money” (we aim to measure the availability of
this, as this is the most meaningful for the end-users)Business
operation: an individual operation a user can perform as part of one use
case or business flow. A high level piece of functionality e.g. get a
quote, set up a transfer, pay in for the transferAPI endpoint: a
technical term. Which HTTP(S) API to invoke in order to perform a
Business operation. Not a service or a series of calls, a single HTTP(S)
endpoint to perform a (part or whole) of Business
operation.Availability: A ratio of successful operations (i.e not server
errors) to total occurrences for a given time-frame. E.g. 9943/10000 =
0.9943Downtime: Number of seconds the application produces errors,
behaves erroneously, or is not reachable.Uptime: Ratio of number of
seconds the application did not produce errors, or behaved erroneously
to the total number of seconds of the observed period.Uptime
vs. AvailabilityPeople often use these two terms interchangeably.
However, they mean different things. Let’s build from the
definition:Availability and uptime are both a ratio (%) of “good to
total”.However it is very important to recognize that their viewpoint is
totally different:Availability is representative of the share of
successful operations (regardless of their distribution in time).Uptime
is representative of the share of time where we could successfully
complete operations (regardless of how many operations were actually
performed).Naturally if we have a perfectly even traffic pattern
(e.g. exactly one operation attempted every minute all the time forever)
uptime and availability will be the same nominal number.In real-life
application traffic is almost never perfectly even. There are
daily/weekly/monthly (and so on) seasonalities, and spikes and valleys
in traffic. If we measure the real traffic of a real application, its
uptime and availability will never be the same nominal number! They will
represent the same reality, but from different perspectives.In general,
if outages happen during high-traffic times then uptime will be a higher
number, whereas if they happen during low-traffic times availability
will be higher (for the same outage).For example given the following
operations/errors distribution:Downtime: 100 secondsTotal time: 420
secondsSuccessful operations: 30Total operations: 44Gives availability
of 30/44 = 68.2% and uptime of (420–100)/420 = 76.2%But if the same
downtime happened over a different traffic distribution:Downtime: 100
secondsTotal time: 420 secondsSuccessful operations: 33Total operations:
40Gives availability of 33/40 = 82.5% and uptime of (420–100)/420 =
76.2%There is no right or wrong choice, but given that people often turn
ratios into “downtime seconds” in their heads, we believe it is better
to report uptime to support this subconscious
translation.SimplificationsRigorously pairing all operations to users
performing them, ordering them and painting the various user journeys
(which are different for each user), and deciding success or failure of
these journeys is a complex and resource intensive endeavour —
especially for a large user base, and a large set of product
offerings.Instead, approximating this value based on general user
behaviour is much more feasible and can still produce meaningful
results. In general, this is what the industry does. Not everyone is
going for this much detail, but we believe in transparency and honesty
even if it means we report “less nines”. We measure key business
operations performed by our full user-base and use that information as a
proxy to our overall business flow availability.Ways to measure business
flow uptimeSynthetic testsA common practice to measure a flow is to set
up an automation that behaves as a real production user, and performs a
series of predefined set of business operations (the user journey) and
log the outcome of the journey as a whole.This approach is very easy to
set up, and the frequency of these test runs are completely in our
control. We can set up a perfectly even test schedule (e.g. once a
minute) so it can report both uptime and availability (as with the
perfectly even traffic they are the same nominal number). All in all
easy to set up and report. Wise has been using such black-box approach
for years.The black box test served us quite well when we had a simpler
product offering (one basic journey of sending money).However convenient
it was, the black box testing approach has shortcomings:Does not scale
well for multiple business flows (or multiple branches of a flow), as if
we ramp up variations (and leave frequency intact) we’d generate so much
load on our system for just the “test” that our actual users become
negligible load. This is one of the reasons why some other companies
(e.g. Google) are also moving away from synthetic monitoring and
gravitate towards real user monitoring.When the product improves, APIs
change. So the test needs immediate upgrade. The test can also break
when APIs are retired or changed around. This can be manageable so long
as there are only a few of these blackbox tests (ties back to scaling
issues).When the tester tool is down we cannot calculate or backfill
data for the lost time period (that we need for accurate reporting).This
has happened a few times with Wise. Some internal rules of some internal
API had changed, and suddenly we needed an extra step in the user
journey to fulfil strong customer authentication. The test itself was
down. Real users did not experience downtime, but our tooling suggested
so. In these cases we had to choose from the following options:Assume
that a few minutes (or hours) never happened as we have no reliable
dataAssume we were “up” based on user contacts and logs of real user
interactionsReport outrageously low numbers even though the system was
up, because the measurement tool was down.Usually we opted for the first
option and had a small asterisk in the report warning about resolution
issues. Then we would run our incident process to make sure we catch
these earlier next time without user impact. Then, next time, something
completely different broke the test without user impact. As we got more
and more processes around our tests, these got less and less frequent
but still happened. New errors always find a way.Test users are often
handled differently than real users by backend applications.In our
example we had a test user (in the live production database) that was
creating 1000+ transfers — every single day. Some of our KYC (Know Your
Customer) and AML (anti-money laundering) systems regularly look for
suspicious transactions and behavioural patterns to help prevent
malicious actors misusing or taking advantage of our systems. The test
user had to be exempted, as it would’ve tripped all the alarms. So in
this sense our measurement (in order to keep the company running) was no
longer doing the exact same thing users do… It did most of it, but had
to pass fewer checks. What if those checks we skipped had bugs? We’d
miss reporting their downtime. So for these reasons we turned away from
synthetic availability/uptime measurements.White Box testing: track
business operations of real usersThese shortcomings above made us
consider turning away from synthetic load and blackbox testing to
measure organic load of real users. This approach is more representative
of user-experienced availability and uptime, and scales much better for
our vast product offering. However it comes with its own
trade-offs.Traffic is no longer perfectly even, as people tend to move
money in their business hours, so we have quite the seasonality
depending on which part of the world is in office hours at any given
time. So uptime and availability is no longer the same nominal
number.Measuring uptime with real world traffic is not as
straightforward as availability.As discussed above, given that people
often turn ratios into “downtime seconds”, we believe it is better to
report uptime to support this subconscious translation. In the next
sections we will focus on getting uptime/downtime from real user
actions.Most real users interact with our API through our clients, which
have aggressive retries and fallbacks to make their experience smooth
even if the backend is having issues. Transient API errors are not
reflected in our website/mobile app experience. However this is very
hard to factor in. From our backend’s perspective, retries are
independent requests; one fails, the other succeeds. We also have a
large customer base who are directly consuming our production API (Wise
Platform is used by many partners across the globe), so we cannot rely
on their retries.All in all, counting even the transient errors is
accurate for direct API customers, and even though it is a less nominal
uptime than the ones our web and mobile users actually experience it is
a sufficient “at least this good, probably better” numberDowntime
vs. approximate downtime of operationsCalculating real downtime from
real (non-generated) traffic needs us to enumerate all requests and
count the times elapsed between first failed and the next successful
request. This is only easy if you have a single queue of requests.
Distributed systems designed to be redundant and reliable are just not
that simple — they are never “completely down”: some parts might work
while others don’t at the same time.A simple way of approximating
downtime is to aggregate away the traffic-pattern of availability. This
will not produce the exact same result, but is much easier to calculate
and reasonably similar.Given a short time window (in Wise, 1 minute) we
can consider the traffic “constant”. With that assumption we can
represent the uptime of an API endpoint for a short period by the
availability of it. To get its downtime, we simply subtract the uptime
from the window length itself.The smaller this time window is the better
the approximation. 5 minute window is commonly used. Wise used 2 minutes
for a few months, and then we have improved to use 1 minute windows.From
there, to get the downtime of a meaningful period we simply sum up the
downtime of the small windows the period consists of.Aggregate downtime
of operations to flowsAs described above we have a good way of
approximating the downtime of each and all important business operations
(that each have a single API endpoint we can measure the availability
of). The general public (customers, auditors, stakeholders) want a
“Single number” representing the full business flow uptime — not 8–10
uptimes for the operations it consists of. To get that reportable number
we need to make a trade-off:First of all let’s declare what do we mean
by “down” for a business flow: The business flow is down if at least one
of the operations it consists of is down.Option one: “the sum of
downtimes of all operations in a business flow is the overall downtime
of the flow”.This assumes that each operation was down at strictly
separate times. I.e. at all times there were exactly 1 operation
down.This is a good “worst case” scenario. It is the equivalent of “at
least this good, but probably better”.Option two: “the highest of
downtimes of all operations in a business flow is the overall downtime
(i.e. minimum uptime represents all)”.This assumes that all operations
were down at exactly the same time. No exceptions. Either everything
worked or nothing.This is a kind of “best case” scenario, and for
simpler business flows it might be the closest to the truth. Engineers
don’t really like it as it is very rare that everything is down. Mostly
this is too kind to the business. It is the equivalent of “we were down
for at least this amount of time, and maybe some more, but this is the
biggest contributor”Option three: “the average of downtimes of all
operations in a business flow is the overall uptime”.This aggregation
tries to make up outliers by averaging them out. It is used by some key
players, e.g. Revolut does “Daily uptime is defined as the percentage of
minutes in the day where the average technical error rate was below
5%.”They do an extremely detailed breakdown though and they are
transparent about this averaging.At Wise we believe it is always too
kind to the business to do averages of business operation
uptime/availability for operations that are part of the same business
flow, as it will always be more “up” than option one, which we know is a
good minimum.Option four: “a middle point of the known good minimum and
known good maximum”I.e. We say we are sure the downtime of a business
flow is always between the sum of its operations (option 1) and max of
them (option 2). So we get the middle point (average) of this number,
and highlight our confidence interval.Example:Uptime of business
operations for 2024 Q2:Minimum uptime of any single operation:
99.958%Sum of all downtimes: 7514.5 seconds (There were 7862399 seconds
in 2024/Q2) making uptime 99.904%So we know that our API customers were
able to complete the full flow between 99.904% and 99.958% in
2024/Q2.The middle point of it is 99.931% (with +- 0.027% confidence
band)How Wise will report business flow uptime from now on:We will shift
where we can to report uptime, not availabilityWe will report our API
uptime regardless of our client-side web/mobile retries as we have a
large direct API customer base and deciding a threshold of transient
issues would just cause more confusion for a slightly greater nominal
uptime value that only applies to some of our customers.We track our
uptime per business operationWe aggregate that number for business
flows:We add all downtimes of all operations of a flow to get the worst
possible value (assuming exactly one of them were down the same time)We
choose the maximum downtime of a single operation (assuming all of them
were down the same time)Then since neither exactly 1, nor all of our
operations are down at the same time, we average these numbers to get a
middle point and report the difference between min/max and average for
transparency.Onwards.Measuring meaningful availability / uptime of Wise
was originally published in Wise Engineering on Medium, where people are
continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this
story.</p>
