      <description>At DoorDash, we embrace AI as a tool to enhance the interview process, not to replace authenticity. Candidates are encouraged to use AI for preparation, like building resumes or exploring interview questions, but must showcase their true selves during interviews. Remember, honesty is key! Misrepresenting your skills could lead to disqualification. For any accommodations regarding AI use, communicate with your recruiter early on. #DoorDash #AIInInterviews #JobPreparation #Authenticity&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Managing memory effectively is crucial for optimizing GPU performance in CUDA. Global memory, the main memory space on CUDA devices, can be accessed by both the host and threads within a kernel grid. It is allocated using the &lt;strong&gt;device&lt;/strong&gt; declaration or CUDA runtime APIs like cudaMalloc(). Data transfers between host and device are done using cudaMemcpy(), while memory can be freed with cudaFree().

      <description>üöÄ Migrating code can be tough, but Cursor AI simplifies the process! Our team transitioned a Bash test suite to Python using the Cursor AI code editor. After installing and logging in, we enabled specific AI models to assist with the migration. Cursor helped analyze the Bash scripts, generated a Python library, and created basic tests automatically. The result? A significant time-saving of about 1.5 months! For a detailed look at the process, check our documentation. #CodeMigration #CursorAI&amp;hellip;</description>
