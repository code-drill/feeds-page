      <description>🚀 Etsy&amp;rsquo;s search team has implemented the Speculation Rules API (SRA) to enhance product page performance significantly. By prefetching pages, they&amp;rsquo;ve achieved improvements of 20-24% across various metrics. Key highlights include two methods of prefetching: traditional and speculative, with SRA offering advantages in caching and performance. The team also learned valuable lessons about user interaction and analytics during the implementation process. #Etsy #WebPerformance #SRA #TechInnovation&amp;hellip;</description>
