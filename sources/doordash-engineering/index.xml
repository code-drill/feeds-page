      <description>At DoorDash, we embrace AI as a tool to enhance the interview process, not to replace authenticity. Candidates are encouraged to use AI for preparation, like building resumes or exploring interview questions, but must showcase their true selves during interviews. Remember, honesty is key! Misrepresenting your skills could lead to disqualification. For any accommodations regarding AI use, communicate with your recruiter early on. #DoorDash #AIInInterviews #JobPreparation #Authenticity&amp;hellip;</description>
