      <description>üöÄ Introducing the Diff Risk Score (DRS) from Meta! This AI-driven technology predicts the likelihood of code changes causing production incidents, enhancing software development processes. By analyzing code changes and metadata, DRS generates risk scores, allowing developers to identify potentially risky code. üõ†Ô∏è DRS has notably reduced code freezes during critical periods, boosting productivity while maintaining user experience. For instance, during a key event in 2024, over 10,000 code&amp;hellip;</description>
