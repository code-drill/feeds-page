      <description>GitHub recently addressed issues with outdated defense mechanisms that were blocking legitimate users. 🚫 User feedback revealed that protections added during past incidents were still in place, causing &amp;ldquo;Too many requests&amp;rdquo; errors during normal usage. Investigations showed these rules, originally designed to combat abuse, were inadvertently affecting genuine requests. 🔍 The findings highlight the importance of observability and lifecycle management in maintaining effective defense systems&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <description>🚀 GitHub is enhancing SSH access security with a new post-quantum secure key exchange algorithm called sntrup761x25519-sha512. This upgrade will protect Git data against future quantum computing threats. 🔒 The changes will take effect on September 17, 2025, and will only affect SSH connections, leaving HTTPS access unchanged. 🔧 Users with compatible SSH clients will benefit without needing adjustments. #GitHub #Cybersecurity #PostQuantum #SSH #DataProtection</description>
