      <description>Configuration drift can disrupt project development when environments deviate from intended setups. This often leads to issues like inconsistent test results, broken CI/CD pipelines, and wasted debugging time. Common causes include differing package versions and unshared configuration changes. While teams try to maintain consistency through version pinning and environment files, lapses can still occur. Addressing configuration drift is essential for smoother collaboration. üîçüíªüîß #DevOps&amp;hellip;</description>
