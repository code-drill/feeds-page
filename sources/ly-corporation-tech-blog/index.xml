      <description>üöÄ In the latest installment of &amp;ldquo;Improving Code Quality,&amp;rdquo; Munetoshi Ishikawa discusses handling Iterators in Java and Kotlin. üìú It&amp;rsquo;s crucial to check for the existence of the next element using &lt;code&gt;hasNext&lt;/code&gt; before calling &lt;code&gt;next&lt;/code&gt;. Failing to do so results in a &lt;code&gt;NoSuchElementException&lt;/code&gt;. üîç To enhance safety, Ishikawa introduces the &lt;code&gt;SafeIterator&lt;/code&gt; class, which returns null when there are no more elements. #CodeQuality #Java #Kotlin #SoftwareDevelopment #ProgrammingTips</description>
