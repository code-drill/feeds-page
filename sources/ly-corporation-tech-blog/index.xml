      <description>ð ï¸ In the latest article by Munetoshi Ishikawa, the focus is on code quality through the lens of anemia misdiagnosis. The discussion revolves around two modulesâfoo-module and bar-moduleâeach with their own data models: FooModel and BarModel. The article highlights how conversion logic between these models was integrated to avoid an anemic domain model, ensuring better data handling. For developers, this insight emphasizes the importance of architecture in maintaining clean code. #CodeQuality&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>ð Session 42 of &amp;ldquo;Improving Code Quality&amp;rdquo; focuses on theoretical testing in mobile development. Munetoshi Ishikawa discusses how to manage different account types (FREE, PREMIUM, etc.) with icons. If AccountType is solely for UI, icons can be properties. However, for broader usage, a conversion mechanism using a Map is more effective. Explore efficient coding strategies! ð»â¨ #CodeQuality #SoftwareDevelopment #MobileDev #Programming #TheoreticalTesting</description>
