      <description>🚀 Upgrading from Python 3.8 to 3.10 revealed a memory leak at Lyft. During the upgrade, we noticed increased latency and timeouts in one service, linked to repository queries causing thread join delays. Using our internal memory profiling tool, we traced the issue to a compatibility problem between gevent and urllib3. Downgrading urllib3 resolved the leak! For memory leak issues, consider using gunicorn&amp;rsquo;s max-request settings to prevent OOM errors. #Python #MemoryManagement #LyftEngineering&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>🚀 At Lyft, machine learning drives key operations like dispatch and pricing. As our platform expanded, we faced challenges with complexity and scalability. 📈 To tackle this, we restructured LyftLearn from a fully Kubernetes-based system to a hybrid model. This combines AWS SageMaker for offline tasks and Kubernetes for online serving, optimizing performance and simplifying architecture. 🔍 The transition involved significant technical adjustments, ensuring seamless workflows for our data&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>🚗 Excited to share insights from my journey as a Data Scientist at Lyft, focusing on my starter project with the Rider Experience Score (RES) tool. RES helps measure the long-term impact of rider experiences, like ETA, on retention without relying solely on A/B tests. 📊 I navigated various challenges to improve the RES pipeline, collaborating with colleagues to identify key rider experiences and ensure accurate causal estimates.

      <description>🚀 Lyft has successfully migrated its Android codebase to Kotlin, a journey that began in 2018. The Rider, Driver, and Urban Solutions apps are now fully Kotlin-based. This transition offers benefits like concise code, faster compile speeds with the K2 compiler, and support for modern UI frameworks like Compose. To manage the migration, Lyft utilized a tool called Migration Tracker, which monitors progress and helps automate the process. Challenges included issues with the migration tool and&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>🚗💡 Ridesharing platforms like Lyft tackle complex matching challenges daily. Each rider and driver represents a unique piece in a dynamic puzzle, requiring real-time solutions for efficient urban mobility. Graph theory helps model these matches, particularly through bipartite graphs. This allows for flexible connections based on factors like distance and time. Lyft&amp;rsquo;s dispatch team continually processes millions of potential decisions, aiming to optimize pickups and driver earnings. Stay tuned&amp;hellip;</description>
