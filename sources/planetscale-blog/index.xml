      <description>üöÄ Postgres 18 has arrived, showcasing major enhancements in read performance with async I/O and new I/O worker threads. The new io_method option allows users to control disk I/O behavior, introducing worker and io_uring modes. These aim to optimize performance, particularly for read operations. Benchmark tests using sysbench focused on read-only scenarios across various EC2 configurations. Results show that Postgres 18 in sync and worker modes outperformed version 17 on network-attached&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>üöÄ A new hybrid design for scalable vector indexes is making waves in relational databases like MySQL. This innovative approach addresses the challenges of indexing multi-dimensional vectors for real-world applications. Existing research often overlooks the practical needs of relational databases, particularly in terms of storage and transactional requirements. The solution incorporates a well-known data structure, Hierarchical Navigable Small Worlds (HNSW), that enhances approximate nearest&amp;hellip;</description>

      <title>Postgres High Availability with CDC</title>
      <link>/articles/article-2025-09-12-9622/</link>

      <description>Postgres High Availability can face challenges with Change Data Capture (CDC). The design of Postgres‚Äô replication introduces complexities that may stall failover. The primary system emits Write Ahead Logs (WAL) to standbys. However, if a CDC client lags, it can prevent effective failover, as the logical replication slot on the primary depends on the client&amp;rsquo;s progress. Postgres 17 introduced logical replication failover, but eligibility for promotion has specific requirements. If the CDC&amp;hellip;</description>
