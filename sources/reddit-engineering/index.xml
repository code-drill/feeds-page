      <description>📢 Reddit is updating how subreddit activity is displayed! The “Member count” will be replaced with two new metrics: &lt;strong&gt;Visitors&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Contributions&lt;/strong&gt;. This change aims to better showcase active participation in communities. - &lt;strong&gt;Visitors&lt;/strong&gt; tracks unique users in the past week. - &lt;strong&gt;Contributions&lt;/strong&gt; counts posts and comments made in the same timeframe. These updates reflect current engagement rather than just subscriber numbers. #RedditUpdates #CommunityEngagement #SocialMediaMetrics</description>
