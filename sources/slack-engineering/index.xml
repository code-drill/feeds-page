      <description>🚀 Last year, we discussed the evolution of our Chef infrastructure and its transition from a single stack to a multi-stack model. At Slack, service reliability is key. We explored moving to Chef Policyfiles but opted to enhance our existing EC2 framework instead. This approach minimizes disruption while improving deployment safety. We split our production Chef environment into multiple isolated buckets, increasing resilience and allowing independent updates. This strategy helps mitigate risks&amp;hellip;</description>
