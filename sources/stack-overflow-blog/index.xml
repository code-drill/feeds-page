      <description>üîí JavaScript is essential for web development, but it also attracts attackers. This article highlights ten tips for writing secure JavaScript, focusing on preventing cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. XSS allows attackers to execute malicious code directly in users&amp;rsquo; browsers, which can compromise security. Key recommendations include input validation, output encoding, and using Content Security Policy (CSP) headers. Implementing these measures can significantly reduce the risk of XSS&amp;hellip;</description>

Today, we enjoy environments with AI support, syntax highlighting, and version control. However, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t always this way. In the 1960s, developers used punch cards to code. Each card held just 80 characters, leading to stacks of cards for larger programs. Debugging was a tedious process, often done on paper.
