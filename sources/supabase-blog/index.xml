      <description>ð Understanding authentication is key for developers. While itâs essential in almost every app, it&amp;rsquo;s often not the main focus. Supabase Auth provides a ready-made solution, integrating directly with your Postgres database. It offers JWT-based security and seamless Row Level Security integration. Building your own authentication can lead to hidden costs, such as time and maintenance, which can divert resources from core development. Consider your options carefully! ðð» #Supabase #Authentication&amp;hellip;</description>
