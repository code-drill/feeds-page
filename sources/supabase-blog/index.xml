      <title>Adding Async Streaming to Postgres Foreign Data Wrappers</title>

      <description>🚀 Supabase Wrappers is enhancing Postgres Foreign Data Wrappers (FDWs) by introducing asynchronous streaming! This update allows more efficient, memory-safe queries for large analytical workloads. Traditionally, FDWs operated synchronously, fetching all results or fixed-size batches, which could block the Postgres backend. With this new approach, users can expect improved performance in querying external databases. #Postgres #DataStreaming #Supabase #ForeignDataWrappers #DatabasePerformance</description>

      <description>🔍 Understanding authentication is key for developers. While it’s essential in almost every app, it&amp;rsquo;s often not the main focus. Supabase Auth provides a ready-made solution, integrating directly with your Postgres database. It offers JWT-based security and seamless Row Level Security integration. Building your own authentication can lead to hidden costs, such as time and maintenance, which can divert resources from core development. Consider your options carefully! 🔒💻 #Supabase #Authentication&amp;hellip;</description>
