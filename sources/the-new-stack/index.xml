      <description>Figma-to-code tools promise to simplify design-to-code transitions, but they often miss the mark. 🚫 While they can generate visually appealing previews, the underlying code is static and hard to maintain. Styles are hard-coded, and components lack interactivity. This leads to challenges in scalability and reusability. A component-first approach can address these issues by focusing on modular, production-ready components that align with design systems. #Figma #Code #WebDevelopment&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>🚀 As organizations adopt Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and AI systems, poor data serialization is causing significant token waste, consuming 40% to 70% of available tokens. This inefficiency leads to inflated API costs and reduced model performance, especially at scale. A single inefficient record can waste hundreds of tokens, impacting the viability of AI deployments. 💡 Understanding token optimization is essential. Key strategies include: 1. &lt;strong&gt;Eliminating Structural Redundancy&lt;/strong&gt;:&amp;hellip;</description>
